--- CHAPTER 1 - Introduction to joins

--- INNER JOIN

SELECT * 
FROM cities;

SELECT * 
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

SELECT cities.name AS city, countries.name AS country, region
FROM cities 
INNER JOIN countries 
ON cities.country_code = countries.code;

--- INNER JOIN (2)

SELECT c.code AS country_code, c.name, e.year, e.inflation_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code;

-- wrong way
SELECT c.code, c.name, c.region, p.year, p.fertility_rate, e.year, e.unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code;

-- right way
SELECT c.code, c.name, c.region, p.fertility_rate, e.year, e.unemployment_rate
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN populations AS p
ON c.code = p.country_code
INNER JOIN economies AS e
ON c.code = e.code
AND p.year = e.year;

--- Inner join with using

SELECT c.name AS country, continent, l.name AS language, l.official
FROM countries AS c
INNER JOIN languages AS l
USING (code);

--- Self-join

SELECT p1.country_code, 
       p1.size AS size2010,
       p2.size AS size2015
FROM populations AS p1
INNER JOIN populations AS p2
ON  p1.country_code = p2.country_code
AND p1.year = p2.year - 5;

SELECT p1.country_code, 
       p1.size AS size2010,
       p2.size AS size2015,
       ((p2.size - p1.size) / p1.size * 100.0) AS growth_perc
FROM populations AS p1
INNER JOIN populations AS p2
ON  p1.country_code = p2.country_code
AND p1.year = p2.year - 5;

--- Case when and then

-- get name, continent, code, and surface area
SELECT name, continent, code, surface_area,
    -- first case
    CASE WHEN surface_area > 2000000
    -- first then
            THEN 'large'
    -- second case
       WHEN surface_area > 350000
       -- second then
            THEN 'medium'
    -- else clause + end
       ELSE 'small' END 
    -- alias resulting field of CASE WHEN
       AS geosize_group
-- from the countries table
FROM countries;

--- Inner challenge

SELECT p.country_code, p.size,
  -- start CASE here with WHEN and THEN

  -- layout other CASE conditions here
    WHEN size > 1000000
        THEN 'medium'
  -- end CASE here with ELSE & END

  -- provide the alias of popsize_group to SELECT the new field
    AS popsize_group
-- which table?
FROM populations AS p
-- any conditions to check?
WHERE p.year = 2015;

---

SELECT p.country_code, p.size,

ORDER BY geosize_group;

--- CHAPTER 2 - Outer joins and cross joins

--- Left Join

-- get the city name (and alias it), the country code,
-- the country name (and alias it), the region,
-- and the city proper population

-- sort based on descending country code
ORDER BY code DESC;

--- Left join (2)

/*
select country name AS country, the country's local name,
the language name AS language, and
the percent of the language spoken in the country
*/
SELECT c.name AS country, local_name, l.name AS language, percent
-- countries on the left (alias as c)

-- inner join with languages (as l) on the right
LEFT JOIN languages AS l
-- give fields to match on

--- Left join (3)

-- select name, region, and gdp_percapita
SELECT name, region, gdp_percapita

--- Right join

-- convert this code to use RIGHT JOINs instead of LEFT JOINs
/*

SELECT *
-- 2010 table will be on top
FROM economies2010
-- which set theory clause?
UNION
-- pick specified columns from 2015 table

--- CHAPTER 4 - Subqueries

--- Subquery inside where

SELECT AVG(life_expectancy)
FROM populations
WHERE year = 2015;

--- 

SELECT *
FROM populations

-- from the cities table
FROM cities AS city
-- with city name in the field of capital cities
WHERE city.name IN
  (SELECT capital
   FROM countries)

--- Subquery inside select

SELECT countries.name AS country, COUNT(*) AS cities_num
FROM cities
INNER JOIN countries
ON countries.code = cities.country_code
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY cities_num DESC, country
LIMIT 9;

--- Same as

---

SELECT MAX(inflation_rate) AS max_inf
  FROM (
      SELECT name, continent, inflation_rate

FROM economies
WHERE year = 2015 AND code NOT IN
  (SELECT code

--- Final challenges

SELECT DISTINCT c.name, e.total_investment, e.imports
FROM countries AS c
LEFT JOIN economies AS e
ON (c.code = e.code AND c.code IN 
    (SELECT code 
    FROM languages

---

-- choose fields
SELECT region, continent, AVG(fertility_rate) AS avg_fert_rate

---

SELECT name, country_code, city_proper_pop, metroarea_pop,
